 * The demons had captured the princess (P) and imprisoned her in the
 * bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid
 * out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight (K) was initially positioned in the
 * top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the
 * princess.
 * 
 * The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If
 * at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.
 * 
 * Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health
 * (negative integers) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty
 * (0's) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (positive
 * integers).
 * 
 * In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to
 * move only rightward or downward in each step.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that he
 * is able to rescue the princess.
 * 
 * For example, given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must
 * be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN ->
 * DOWN.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * -2 (K)
 * -3
 * 3
 * 
 * 
 * -5
 * -10
 * 1
 * 
 * 
 * 10
 * 30
 * -5 (P)
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * The knight's health has no upper bound.
 * Any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight
 * enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.
